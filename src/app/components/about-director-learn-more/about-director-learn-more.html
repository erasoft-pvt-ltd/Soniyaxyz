        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I began my career in 2005 with Intai Technology in the telecom sector. As a B.Tech (CSE) graduate with an MBA in HR & Marketing, I was entrusted with the responsibility of recruitment and candidate shortlisting. During this journey, I realized something important—most candidates did not fully understand the value of a job. They were unsure of what to do, how to do it, and, above all, why they should pursue a job. The lack of clarity about their mission and objectives often held them back from achieving true growth.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            To address this gap, I joined GNext India Solution, where I worked extensively on career guidance. I visited various colleges and universities, interacted with students directly, and helped them discover the right path through proper guidance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            In 2019, I became a part of UPSDM, where skill training and placement were the core objectives. This experience solidified my belief that recruitment should not be limited to filling vacancies but should focus on preparing and guiding candidates to find careers aligned with their strengths and aspirations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            With this vision, in December 2024, I co-founded Sarv Siddh Management Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. along with my partner. Our mission is simple yet impactful—
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            To provide companies with motivated, skilled, and job-ready employees.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            To help candidates find meaningful careers that match their interests and allow them to grow and succeed.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">            
            At Sarv Siddh, we believe in creating the perfect match between companies and candidates. Because when the right talent meets the right opportunity, both flourish.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            As I stepped into the world of HR and Administration in 2019 with Dixon Technologies, With an MBA in HR and Marketing, Apart of administration I was ready to take on recruitment and candidate shortlisting. But what I wasn't ready for was the realization that most candidates were navigating the job market without a clear roadmap.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I saw talented individuals struggling to find their footing, unsure of what they wanted or how to get there. It was like watching someone try to find their way through a dense forest without a compass. That's when it hit me – the key to success lies not just in filling vacancies, but in guiding candidates towards careers that ignite their passions.

            My journey took a pivotal turn at UKb India Solution,in 2021  where I honed my skills in recruitment and career guidance. I had the privilege of interacting with students, understanding their aspirations, and nudging them towards their rightful paths.
